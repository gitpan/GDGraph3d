DESCRIPTION
    This is the GD::Graph3d extensions module. It provides 3D graphs
    for the GD::Graph module by Martien Verbruggen, which in turn
    generates graph using Lincoln Stein's GD.pm.

    You use these modules just as you would any of the GD::Graph
    modules, except that they generate 3d-looking graphs.
