DESCRIPTION
    This is the GD-Graph3d extensions module. It provides 3D graphs
    for the GD::Graph module by Martien Verbruggen, which in turn
    generates graph using Lincoln Stein's GD.pm.

    You use these module just as you would any of the GD::Graph
    modules, except that they generate 3d-looking graphs. Each graph
    type is described below with only the options that are unique to
    the 3d version. The modules are based on their 2d versions (e.g.
    GD::Graph::bars3d works like GD::Graph::bars), and support all
    the options in those. Make sure to read the documentation on
    GD::Graph.
